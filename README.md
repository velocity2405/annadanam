An open source food donation app which acts as a middleman between generous humans who are willing to donate and helpful charitable organizations on the field.
Created as part of a hackathon project by Me, Aryan Agrawal, Ibraheem Mohammed and Arush Katrekar, managing to bag a second position in the senior category.

Tutorial:
1) Download the ZIP and run the exe.

3) Login to your account and access the variety of features available.
4) Logout whenever you chose to do so.

There are 2 types of accounts available: 1) Donater and 2) Receiver
Donater account is used be invdividuals willing to donate while receiver accounts are used by charity organizations willing to distribute the goods.
